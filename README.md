# Computer Graphics Research Map

A visualization of computer graphics research areas with foundational and recent papers.

Like I said, Iâ€™m a first-year MPhil student, and I was actually not so sure about my future research directions. But after my internship, I did get a little bit interested in Computer Graphics, physics related specifically. So, I want to dive into the field of Computer Graphics and get to see what this science is about and what the frontier cg research is doing in history, and what they are doing now.
